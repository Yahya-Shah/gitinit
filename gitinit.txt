time to learn git init
how to make a file a directory or repository

To do it,
make a directory on your computer (file)
go to terminal add the path 
By default any directory on computer is not a git repository, To make it a git repository give command -> gitinit
Now this is an empty git repository
Now we have to add it git file
for that type in terminal -> git add filename
you check it from git status then
now there is no origin at now, because there is no remote made to github as the file was made on the computer 
Go to github and make a repository 
go to terminal type -> git remote add origin repository-link 
type -> git remote (you will have the origin now)
Now push the code by typing -> git push origin master
the file will be pushed 
Now open github 
Open the file 
edit the file on git hub
go back to terminal and type -> git pull origin master 
and you will see the changes made
